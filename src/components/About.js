            <p>My partner Magdalena and I have been diving in commercial dumpsters since 2018. In 2019, we created an instagram account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/trash.pandas_ofnyc/?hl=en">@trash.pandas_ofNYC</a> and we started a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQGM2bcNxW9mAuIU95k3llQI_n396jS7gEC-2j7huUvP8ctfU_OlkSygpK2A3uA2kjIphcQX8L_oJ6p/pubhtml">spreadsheet</a> to document the amount of waste we were finding regularly.</p>
            <p>We continued through the pandemic, dumpster-diving six nights a week most weeks. After about a year and a half of trenchant data collection, we documented $150,000 of goods!</p>
            <p>Now I've taken to designing this site as a way to publish these findings, to shoutout to all the amazing people we met and collaborated with along the way, and to begin to unpack all of the multifarious lessons we learned along the way.</p>
