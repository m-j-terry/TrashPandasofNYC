            <h2>Putting Waste into Perspective</h2>	
            <p><a href="https://www.janssenpmp.com/sustainability/articles/up-to-40-percent-of-food-is-wasted-before-it-reaches-the-market#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Food%20and,not%20reach%20the%20end%20consumer.">40% of food</a> is wasted each year in the United States.</p>	
            <p>But what does that look like? Where does that all go—or not go?</p>	
            <p>That is nearly <a href="https://www.rts.com/resources/guides/food-waste-america/">60 million tons</a>—120 billion pounds—each year, worth <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2022/07/14/food-waste-costs-us-taxpayers-billions-of-dollars-a-year/?sh=51a4114542ea">$400 billion</a>.<sup>1</sup></p>
            <p><a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/food-security-and-nutrition-assistance/#:~:text=The%20prevalence%20of%20food%20insecurity,of%20a%20lack%20of%20resources.">12.8% of households</a><sup>2</sup> in the US—including <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/child-hunger-facts#:~:text=More%20than%2013%20million%20children,will%20get%20their%20next%20meal.">13 million children</a>—are food insecure while 40% of the food resources are wasted.</p>
            <p>Hunger is not unsolvable; it is not a problem of resources but of structure.</p>
            <p>What about that $400 billion?</p>
            <p>Wasted food costs taxpayers <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2022/07/14/food-waste-costs-us-taxpayers-billions-of-dollars-a-year/?sh=51a4114542ea">billions</a> each year, as corporations receive a tax-deduction for the 'cost of shrinkage' or loss of profits.<sup>3</sup></p>
            <p>Produce that winds up in the landfill cannot break down properly due to a lack of oxygen and produces methane, which has a greenhouse effect <a href="https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/oil-gas-and-coal/methane-emissions_en#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20methane's%20ability%20to,on%20a%2020%2Dyear%20timescale.">~80x more potent than that of CO2</a>.</p>
            <p>Globally, food waste accounts for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2022/07/14/food-waste-costs-us-taxpayers-billions-of-dollars-a-year/?sh=51a4114542ea">8% of all greenhouse gas emisions</a>.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the farming practices used to maintain the steady flow of food through the market has adverse effects on soil health and nutrient density in food.</p>
            <p>Monocropping depletes soil of nutrients and affects <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/soil-degradation.html#:~:text=Soil%20can%20lose%20certain%20physical,such%20as%20poor%20land%20management.">the biodiversity of microbiota</a> that play a crucial symbiotic role in fighting off pests and promoting plant growth and health.</p>
            <p>Disrupting the topsoil also diminishes the amount of fixed carbon it can store <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/soil-degradation.html#:~:text=Soil%20can%20lose%20certain%20physical,such%20as%20poor%20land%20management.">by 50-75%</a>, thereby contributing to and exacerbating the effects of climate change.</p>
            <p>In order to combat weeds and pests, farmers resort to toxic pesticides and herbicides that further damage the soil microbiome, creating a negative feedback loop.</p>
            <p>As of 2019, estimates say that the food industry generates <a href="https://www.plasticsoupfoundation.org/en/2021/12/food-production-causes-plastic-pollution/#:~:text=FAO%20estimates%20that%20in%202019,biggest%20user%2C%20up%20to%202030.">12.5 million tons of single use plastic</a> annually.</p>
            <p>Assuming an even 40% of this plastic goes to the landfill, that is 5 million tons of unnecessary plastic each year.</p>
            <p>Plastic is not 'broken down' and recycled like organic molecules; instead, it breaks apart into smaller microplastics and nanoplastics, which get into our water and food.</p>
            <p>These microplastics have been detected in blood samples in almost <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/24/microplastics-found-in-human-blood-for-first-time#:~:text=Microplastic%20pollution%20has%20been%20detected,and%20may%20lodge%20in%20organs.">80% of people tested</a> and in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/27/microplastics-found-every-human-placenta-tested-study-health-impact#:~:text=The%20research%2C%20published%20in%20the,common%20plastics%20detected%2C%20after%20polyethylene.">every human placenta tested</a>.</p>
            <p>While research on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10151227/">the health effects of exposure to microplastics on humans</a> is still limited, research shows that high <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9205308/">high concentrations of microplastics are harmful to smaller life forms</a>.</p>
